### Angular, Firebase and Typescript Exercise for Epicodus, 04/08/2018
### By Tyler Kostelak

## Description
_This project was a foray into utilizing the Angular Framework and Firebase file storage to allow users to upload photos to a server less database._

## Specifications

### Behavior Driven Development

1. First, the user should be able to create an account on the site.

2. After the user has created an account, they should be able to successfully log in and log out of the site. They should not be able to access content when they are not logged in.

3. Now that the user can log into the site, they should be able to upload either a photo or multiple photos to their gallery that is hosted on the site.

4. Once the user has added photos to the gallery, they should be able to navigate to the gallery tab and view all of the photos that are stored on the site.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the following commands in the terminal:
   npm Install
   ng server
3. Navigate your browser (preferably Chrome) to http://localhost:4200
4. In order to sign in, you may use the following guest login:

   _password: password123_
5. Enjoy using the app!

## Known Bugs
Console error: "Refused to apply style from 'http://localhost:4200/.styles.css' because its MIME type ('text/html') is not a supported stylesheet MIME type, and strict MIME checking is enabled.""
