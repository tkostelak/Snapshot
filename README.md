# PhotoEditor

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Specifications

1. First, a user should be able to add a photo to the site.

2. Once a user has added a photo, a workspace should appear that allows the user to add filters to their photo.

3. Once the workspace has appeared, the user should be able to adjust the filter bars in the workspace and the corresponding attribute should be adjusted in the photo.
  i.e: The user slides the saturation bar to the right by two notches, and the saturation of the photo is increased by 20%.

4. If the user does not want to manually adjust photos and would prefer presets, they should be able to select pre-made filters, and when clicked, they should adjust the filter bars automatically for the user.

5. Once the user is done editing a photo, they should be able to add it to a gallery on the site.
